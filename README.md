Implementation of the Augemented Reality Tag Detection Project for ENPM673

## How to run the code

-- Recommended Python : 3

-- Recommended IDE : SPYDER

	Problem_1.py : Code for AR TAG Detection and Orientation

	Problem_2_A.py : Code for Superimposing Testudo on the AR TAG

	Problem_2_B.py : Code for Plotting Cube on the AR TAG

	> Please make sure to have the Tag1 video as well as the testudo.jpg image in the same folder as the code.

	> The main frame, the frame with testudo imposed on it and the AR TAG window are shown in Problem_2_A. The ID and Orientation is displayed in the console/prompt.
        After completion of the video, 'Q' button needs to be pressed twice to shut all the windows.

	> Also make sure all the other videos and required tag images are in the same folder as the codes

	> The video writing commands out.write(line 266) in Problem_2_A and (line 169) in Problem_2_B are commented so as not to lose the original video.
        Please make sure to unhash it if you wish to write a new video.
